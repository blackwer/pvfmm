  summary: pvfmm with periodic boundary conditions
  description: |
    PVFMM is a library for solving certain types of elliptic partial differential equations.

    We support Stokes, Poisson, and Helmholtz problems on the unit cube, with free-space or periodic boundary conditions, with constant or mildly varying coefficients. Our method is based on volume potential integral equation formulation accelerated by the Kernel Independent Fast Multipole Method.
